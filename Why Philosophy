All roads lead to Rome, and all Wikipedia links lead to Philosophy. (link:https://www.bruceb.com/2021/09/all-roads-lead-to-philosophy-in-wikipedia/)

Think deeply about the quote, 'I think therefore I am'. This is a proof of existence. As long as you can think you exist. Your existence depends on the ability to have thought. Even if it is a modicum. 

And if we understand Philosophy as a study of thinking, we can succintly say that Philosophy is looking at our very existence in a mirror.

Of all the core studies, be it the natural sciences or the social science, be it astronomy or geography, everything is philosophy. Everything.

What are the practical benefits of it?

Philosophy wont set you free, or cure your ailments. But it will equip you to face dilemmas. Or maybe fall into one. But here is the deal. Everything which our society uses as its legs to run on, is a consequnce 
of deep thinking and introspection. Justice and fairness are a consequence of ethical philosphy. Maths and Logic are a consequence of the logical branch of philosohpy. And so on. Terms that you take for granted such as 
consumerism are a byproduct of philosohpy. It is a tool with which we try to charter the unknown and come to terms with it.

"Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don't know" - Russell
